# Pomodoro
A simple pomodoro timer that I've built for myself :) I've taken quite a long break from programming so I wanted to practice a bit.

No libraries/frameworks were used. It's vanilla Javascript,CSS and HTML only.

Finished on 8th of November 2020.
The code is kinda messy and I plan to revisit this project in 6 months to see my progress :)
